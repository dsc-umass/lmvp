# LMVP

> Lightweight Model Versioning Platform

## Contributing

Please read the entire guide [here](https://github.com/jbinvnt/small-team-tutorial).

## About
An open source neural network versioning system designed to separate model management functions and computationally expensive training operations.

## Getting Started
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is the recommended way to run the API server. After cloning or downloading the repository, run `export DB_PASSWORD=arbitrarypassword` and then `docker-compose run web python3 manage.py migrate` to build the initial tables in thedatabase. Then run `docker-compose up` to start LMVP. From there, you can navigate to the server in a web browser to see the Django Rest Framework interface, or use another tool to make API requests.

## Features

- Fetch, update, and publish models from anywhere
- Track metrics
- Manage model history on the web
- Add team members, make contributions

### Example commands
```
>>> localModel = lmvp.download(modelName)
```
```
>>> lmvp.showHistory(project)
```
```
>>> lmvp.update(modelname, localModel)
```

## Task Groups

Milestones for each group are available in the *Projects* tab. Please make sure to assign each issue to the correct milestone.

| Group | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Python module | Allow team members to manage their models from Colab or another environment. Makes API requests to the central server. |
| Central server | Provides a REST API for versioning, organization, and model storage. Built using Django REST Framework. |
| Web Interface | The web administrator console to allow project management. Makes API requests to the central server. |

## Docker Hub
You can use Docker to pull an autobuild image from Docker Hub. Right now it is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jbinvnt/lmvp). Be aware that they seem to only work for the x86 architecture, so if you want ARM or something else you will need to build it yourself.

## Troubleshooting starting Docker container

Here are some problems you might run in to when trying to start the docker container:

### psql: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"

This will happen if you tried to start the docker container without exporting the database password first. To fix this, run these commands

`$ docker kill $(docker ps -q)`  
`$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`  
`$ docker rmi $(docker images -q)`

then export the password

`$ export DB_PASSWORD=arbitrarypassword`

and then run these commands to build and run the container

`$ docker-compose run web python3 manage.py migrate`  
`$ docker-compose up`

### Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is 'docker daemon' running on this host?

I ran into this problem while running Docker on a VM with WSL 2. Try installing [docker-desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) on Windows first, and then starting docker on your Linux VM with

`$ sudo service docker start`

To make sure Docker automatically starts on boot, run

`$ sudo systemctl enable docker`

this shouldn't be necessary, but you may as well run it just to be safe.
